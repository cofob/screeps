# Screeps: World

My code for [screeps.com](https://screeps.com/) game.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

2. Create soft link from `dist` to project folder in `~/.config/Screeps/scripts` . In my case command looks like this:

    ```bash
    ln -s ~/projects/screeps-world/dist ~/.config/Screeps/default
    ```

3. Build project:

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

(Code will be update on servers automatically if you have open game.)
